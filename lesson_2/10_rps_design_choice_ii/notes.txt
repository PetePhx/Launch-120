* what is the primary improvement of this new design?

  A More modular design where the comparison method for the moves is taken out
  of the main engine, i.e. RPSGame class and into the Move class.

* what is the primary drawback of this new design?

  We had to define new methods for comparison of moves which makes the code base
  larger and potentially more effort for the reader of the code to comprehend
  the logic for the custom defined < and > operators.
