#  	Object Oriented Programming

This is the repository for the Launch School course 120 lessons and exercises.

A favorite part was implementing the object-oriented version of the game 21, which is a simplified version of black jack. I have added a small simulation module to the game, where besides 'hit' and 'stay', the player had the option to see the odds of win/loss/tie for hit and stay.
