* is this design, with Human and Computer sub-classes, better? Why, or why not?

  The design is better in the sense that there is less code repetition, as well
  as better abstraction of concepts by assigning human and computer each to
  their own respective subclasses.

* what is the primary improvement of this new design?

    More transparent code by assigning different type of players to their
    respective subclasses.

* what is the primary drawback of this new design?

  The initialize method in the Player class called the set_name instance method
  without having the method in place. While we don't instantiate Player class
  directly. This can be a cause of confusion to the code reader.

  An empty set_name method is added for this reason.
